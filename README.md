# -Hardware-Assisted-QR-Code-Generation-Using-Fault-Tolerant-TRNG
True random number generator (TRNG) is used to generate a purely random sequence in key generation. Real-world applications use key bits or strings as a passcode to secure systems. The security of a system depends on a robust design and the ambiguity of the keys that are used so that they are unpredictable. In this proposal, TRNGs are designed using reversible gates and fault-tolerant circuits. So the chance of the TRNG hardware produces faulty output is avoided. The inputs for this system are obtained from CPU usage. The generated true random number sequence is used in generating QR codes due to the uniqueness of the generated sequence. The proposed TRNG design highlights the effectiveness of using reversible fault-tolerant gates for TRNG application over the conventional logic implementation and reversible gate design in terms of power, area, and randomness. The proposed design in 90 nm technology consumes only 25.26 ÂµW of power.
